## Features and Components

The repo `authgear-server` includes the following components of Authgear:

- Authgear server (the core service)
- Portal (a web-interface for managing configurations in Authgear projects)
- AuthUI  (a customizable User Interface (UI) for login, user registration, and profile settings pages)
- Admin API (provides a GraphQL interface for developers to interact with services and data on Authgear)

This repo is the open-source project that powers Authgear's authentication-as-a-service solution. It includes the code for the server, AuthUI, the Portal, and Admin API. You can use it to set up your own self-hosted instance of Authgear service.
