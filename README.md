# AuthGear

Work in progress

## Prerequisite

Note that there is a local .tool-versions in project root. For the following setup to work, we need to

1. Install asdf

2. Run the following to install all dependencies in .tool-versions

   ```sh
   asdf install
   ```

3. Install icu4c

```sh
brew install icu4c
```

icu4c installed by brew is not globally visible by default, so you have to ensure your shell has the following in effect

```sh
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$(brew --prefix)/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig"
```

To avoid doing the above every time you open a new shell, you may want to add it to your shell initialization script such as `~/.profile`, `~/.bash_profile`, etc.

4. Install libvips

```sh
brew install vips
```

libvips on macOS requires `-Xpreprocessor` to build.
Run the following to tell Cgo.

```sh
export CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW="-Xpreprocessor"
```

5. Install libmagic

```sh
brew install libmagic
```

Run the following to tell Cgo where to find libmagic.
Preferably you add it to your shell startup script.

```sh
export CGO_CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix)/include"
export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix)/lib"
```

5. Run `make vendor`

## Environment setup

1. Setup environment variables:

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Initialize app

   To generate the necessary config and secret yaml file, run

   ```sh
   go run ./cmd/authgear init authgear.yaml --output ./var/authgear.yaml
   go run ./cmd/authgear init authgear.secrets.yaml --output ./var/authgear.secrets.yaml
   ```

   then follow the instructions. For database URL and schema, use the following,

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable
   DATABASE_SCHEMA=app
   ```

3. Setup `.localhost` domain

   For cookie to work properly, you need to use

   - `portal.localhost:8000` to access the portal.
   - `accounts.portal.localhost:3000` to access the main server.

   You can either do this by editing `/etc/hosts` or install `dnsmasq`.

4. (Optional) To use db as config source.

   - Update `.env` to change `CONFIG_SOURCE_TYPE=database`
   - Setup config source in db
     ```
     go run ./cmd/portal internal setup-portal ./var/ \
        --default-authgear-domain=accounts.localhost \
        --custom-authgear-domain=accounts.portal.localhost \
     ```

## Database setup

1. Start the db container

   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d db
   ```

2. Create a schema:

   Run the following SQL command with command line to such as `psql` or DB viewer such as `Postico`

   ```sql
   CREATE SCHEMA app;
   ```

3. Apply database schema migrations:

   make sure the db container is running

   ```sh
   go run ./cmd/authgear database migrate up --database-url='postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable' --database-schema=app
   ```

To create new migration:

```sh
# go run ./cmd/authgear database migrate new <migration name>
go run ./cmd/authgear database migrate new add user table
```

## HTTPS setup

TLS is required to perform OAuth and WebAuthn.

To setup HTTPS easily, you can use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)

```sh
# Install mkcert.
brew install mkcert
# Install the root CA into Keychain Access.
mkcert -install
# Generate the TLS certificate
make mkcert
# Uncomment the TLS config in nginx.conf to enable TLS
# Restart proxy
```

One caveat is HTTP redirect to HTTPS is not supported, you have to type in https in the browser address bar manually.

## Running everything

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Then run the command

```sh
# in project root
go run ./cmd/authgear start
```

To run graphql server

```sh
# in project root
go run ./cmd/portal start
```

## Multi-tenant mode

Some features (e.g. custom domains) requires multi-tenant mode to work properly.
To setup multi-tenant mode:

1. Setup local mock Kubernetes servers:
   ```
   cd hack/kube-apiserver
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
2. Install cert manager CRDs:

   ```
   kubectl --kubeconfig=hack/kube-apiserver/.kubeconfig apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.3.1/cert-manager.crds.yaml
   ```

3. Bootstrap Kubernetes resources:

   ```
   kubectl --kubeconfig=hack/kube-apiserver/.kubeconfig apply -f hack/k8s-manifest.yaml
   ```

4. Enable multi-tenant mode in Authgear & portal server:
   refer to `.env.example` for example environment variables to set

## Portal

### Known issues

As `useBlocker` is removed since react-router-domv6.0.0-beta.7 and have no promise which version will
come back, we introduce the custom `useBlocker` hook by referencing the last commit which this hook
still exist.
See [https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/commit/256cad70d3fd4500b1abcfea66f3ee622fb90874](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/commit/256cad70d3fd4500b1abcfea66f3ee622fb90874)

NPM has an outstanding issue related to optional native dependencies.
https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4828
The issue will happen if the following conditions hold:
- The package.json, package-lock.json and node\_modules are in correct state. node\_modules only contain macOS arm dependencies.
- We update the version of parcel and run npm install to update package-lock.json
- package-lock.json becomes invalid.
- npm ci becomes broken on non macOS arm machines
So whenever we want to update dependencies, we first delete node\_modules and package-lock.json.
Then npm install will generate a correct package-lock.json.

When Parcel cannot resolve nodejs globals such as `process` and `Buffer`,
it installs them for us.
But we do not want to do that.
The workaround is to add `alias` to package.json.
See [https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/7697](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/7697).

### Setup environment variable

We need to set up environment variables for Authgear servers and portal server.

Make a copy of `.env.example` as `.env`, and update it if necessary.

### Setup portal development server

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Run development server

```
npm start
```

This command should start a web development server on port 1234.

3. Configure authgear.yaml

We need the following `authgear.yaml` to setup authgear for the portal.

```yaml
id: accounts # Make sure the ID matches AUTHGEAR_APP_ID environment variable.
http:
  # Make sure this matches the host used to access main Authgear server.
  public_origin: "http://accounts.portal.localhost:3000"
  allowed_origins:
    # The SDK uses XHR to fetch the OAuth/OIDC configuration,
    # So we have to allow the origin of the portal.
    # For simplicity, allow all origin for development setup.
    - "*"
oauth:
  clients:
    # Create a client for the portal.
    # Since we assume the cookie is shared, there is no grant nor response.
    - name: Portal
      client_id: portal
      # Note that the trailing slash is very important here
      # URIs are compared byte by byte.
      redirect_uris:
        # This redirect URI is used by the portal development server.
        - "http://portal.localhost:8000/oauth-redirect"
        # This redirect URI is used by the portal production build.
        - "http://portal.localhost:8010/oauth-redirect"
        # This redirect URI is used by the iOS and Android demo app.
        - "com.authgear.example://host/path"
        # This redirect URI is used by the React Native demo app.
        - "com.authgear.example.rn://host/path"
      post_logout_redirect_uris:
        # This redirect URI is used by the portal development server.
        - "http://portal.localhost:8000/"
        # This redirect URI is used by the portal production build.
        - "http://portal.localhost:8010/"
      grant_types: []
      response_types: ["none"]
```

## Create release tag before deployment

```sh
# Create release tag when deploying to staging or production
# For staging, prefix the tag with `staging-`. e.g. staging-2021-05-06.0
# For production, no prefix is needed. e.g 2021-05-06.0
# If there are more than 1 release in the same day, increment the last number by 1
git tag -a YYYY-MM-DD.0

# Show the logs summary
make logs-summary A=<previous tag> B=<current tag>
```

## Keep dependencies up-to-date

Various files in this project have versioned dependencies.

- [The go directive in go.mod](./go.mod)
- [The dependencies listed in go.mod](./go.mod)
- [The tool versions listed in .tool-versions](./.tool-versions)
- [The versions appearing in ./github/workflows/ci.yaml](./github/workflows/ci.yaml)
- [The FROM directives in ./cmd/authgear/Dockerfile](./cmd/authgear/Dockerfile)
- [The FROM directives in ./cmd/portal/Dockerfile](./cmd/portal/Dockerfile)
- [The dependencies in ./authui/package.json](./authui/package.json)
- [The dependencies in ./portal/package.json](./portal/package.json)
- [The dependencies in ./scripts/npm/package.json](./scripts/npm/package.json)
  - Note that you cannot simply upgrade `tzdata` because the version must match that of the server.
  - You can find out the server version by going into the container and run `apt list --installed`.
  - The version of Debian bullseye is `2021a`, which correspond to `tzdata@v1.0.25`.
- [The cropperjs type definition in ./authui/src](./authui/src)
