# AuthGear
 
Work in progress

## Prerequisite

Note that there is a local .tool-versions in project root. For the following setup to work, we need to

1. Install asdf

2. Run the following to install all dependencies in .tool-versions
   ```sh
   asdf install
   ```

3. Install icu4c

On macOS, the simplest way is to install it with brew

```sh
brew install icu4c
```

Note that by default icu4c is not symlinked to /usr/local, so you have to ensure your shell has the following in effect

```sh
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig"
```

To avoid doing the above every time you open a new shell, you may want to add it to your shell initialization script such as `~/.profile`, `~/.bash_profile`, etc.

4. Run `make vendor`

## Environment setup

1. Setup environment variables:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Initialize app

   To generate the necessary config and secret yaml file, run

   ```sh
   go run ./cmd/authgear init authgear.yaml --output ./var/authgear.yaml
   go run ./cmd/authgear init authgear.secrets.yaml --output ./var/authgear.secrets.yaml
   ```

   then follow the instructions. For database URL and schema, use the following,
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable
   DATABASE_SCHEMA=app
   ```

3. Setup `.localhost` domain

   For cookie to work properly, you need to use

   - `portal.localhost:8000` to access the portal.
   - `accounts.portal.localhost:3000` to access the main server.

   You can either do this by editing `/etc/hosts` or install `dnsmasq`.

4. (Optional) To use db as config source.

   - Update `.env` to change `CONFIG_SOURCE_TYPE=database`
   - Setup config source in db
      ```
      go run ./cmd/portal internal setup-portal ./var/ \
         --default-authgear-domain=accounts.localhost \
         --custom-authgear-domain=accounts.portal.localhost \
      ```

## Database setup

1. Start the db container
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d db
   ```

2. Create a schema:

   Run the following SQL command with command line to such as `psql` or DB viewer such as `Postico`

   ```sql
   CREATE SCHEMA app;
   ```

3. Apply database schema migrations:

   make sure the db container is running

   ```sh
   go run ./cmd/authgear database migrate up --database-url='postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable' --database-schema=app
   ```

To create new migration:
```sh
# go run ./cmd/authgear database migrate new <migration name>
go run ./cmd/authgear database migrate new add user table
```

## HTTPS setup

If you are testing external OAuth provider, you must enable TLS.

1. Cookie is only included in third party redirect if it has SameSite=None attribute.
2. Cookie with SameSite=None attribute without Secure attribute is rejected.

To setup HTTPS easily, you can use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)

```sh
# Install mkcert.
brew install mkcert
# Install the root CA into Keychain Access.
mkcert -install
# Create TLS certificate and private key with the given host.
mkcert -cert-file tls-cert.pem -key-file tls-key.pem localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

One caveat is HTTP redirect to HTTPS is not supported, you have to type in https in the browser address bar manually.

## Running everything

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Then run the command

```sh
# in project root
go run ./cmd/authgear start
```

To run graphql server

```sh
# in project root
go run ./cmd/portal start
```

## Multi-tenant mode

Some features (e.g. custom domains) requires multi-tenant mode to work properly.
To setup multi-tenant mode:
1. Setup local mock Kubernetes servers:
    ```
    cd hack/kube-apiserver
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
2. Install cert manager CRDs:
    ```
    kubectl --kubeconfig=hack/kube-apiserver/.kubeconfig apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.3.1/cert-manager.crds.yaml
    ```

3. Bootstrap Kubernetes resources:
   ```
   kubectl --kubeconfig=hack/kube-apiserver/.kubeconfig apply -f hack/k8s-manifest.yaml
   ```

4. Enable multi-tenant mode in Authgear & portal server:
   refer to `.env.example` for example environment variables to set

## Portal

### Known issues

graphql must be 15 otherwise `npm run gentype` will fail.
When graphql is ^15.0.0, we will see missing peer dependency of graphql@^14.0.0
See https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling/issues/2232

@monaco-editor/react>=4 is slow in our usage. We need to adjust how we use it when we upgrade.

react-router-dom>6.0.0-beta.0 introduces a lot of breaking changes. It is better to wait for the RC version.

Parcel 2 uses SWC by default. We wanted to use SWC instead of Babel.
However, code generated by SWC will make Terser unhappy.

```
@parcel/optimizer-terser: "_" is redeclared

    85660 |
  > 85661 | let _ = (t)=>t
  >       |    ^ "\_" is redeclared
    85662 | , t;
    85663 | const $b80ebe06e2f88b5a$export$2b9690ad11995dc7 = $f42f3389fe119bca$export$be13bc7ba690db84(t || (t = _`\n  query AppAndSecretConfigQuery($id: ID!) {\n

  ðŸ’¡ It's likely that Terser doesn't support this syntax yet.
```

### Setup environment variable

We need to set up environment variables for Authgear servers and portal server.

Make a copy of `.env.example` as `.env`, and update it if necessary.

### Setup portal development server

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Run development server

```
npm start
```

This command should start a web development server on port 1234.

3. Configure authgear.yaml

We need the following `authgear.yaml` to setup authgear for the portal.

```yaml
id: accounts # Make sure the ID matches AUTHGEAR_APP_ID environment variable.
http:
  # Make sure this matches the host used to access main Authgear server.
  public_origin: 'http://accounts.portal.localhost:3000'
  allowed_origins:
    # The SDK uses XHR to fetch the OAuth/OIDC configuration,
    # So we have to allow the origin of the portal.
    # For simplicity, allow all origin for development setup.
    - "*"
oauth:
  clients:
    # Create a client for the portal.
    # Since we assume the cookie is shared, there is no grant nor response.
    - name: Portal
      client_id: portal
      # Note that the trailing slash is very important here
      # URIs are compared byte by byte.
      redirect_uris:
        # This redirect URI is used by the portal development server.
        - 'http://portal.localhost:8000/oauth-redirect'
        # This redirect URI is used by the portal production build.
        - 'http://portal.localhost:8010/oauth-redirect'
        # This redirect URI is used by the iOS and Android demo app.
        - 'com.authgear.example://host/path'
        # This redirect URI is used by the React Native demo app.
        - 'com.authgear.example.rn://host/path'
      post_logout_redirect_uris:
        # This redirect URI is used by the portal development server.
        - "http://portal.localhost:8000/"
        # This redirect URI is used by the portal production build.
        - "http://portal.localhost:8010/"
      grant_types: []
      response_types: ["none"]
```

## Create release tag before deployment

```sh
# Create release tag when deploying to staging or production
# For staging, prefix the tag with `staging-`. e.g. staging-2021-05-06.0
# For production, no prefix is needed. e.g 2021-05-06.0
# If there are more than 1 release in the same day, increment the last number by 1
git tag -a YYYY-MM-DD.0

# Show the logs summary
make logs-summary A=<previous tag> B=<current tag>
```

## Updating Auth UI tabler-icons and normalize.css version

The static asset handler requires the file path to have the hash. e.g. authgear.0ab41e6d21d590d0f06589f06a82d876.css.

For URLs rendered in the HTML, the hash will be inserted into the path automatically by using the template function `StaticAssetURL`.

When we update libraries that reference to other static asset files, we should update the file paths with hash.

- In `tabler-icons.min.css`, update all fonts file names with hashes
- In `normalize.min.css`, update `normalize.min.css.map` with hash
- In `authgear.css`, update intl-tel-input flag image names with hashes.
