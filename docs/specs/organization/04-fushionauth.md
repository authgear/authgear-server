# A brief research on how Organization works in FushionAuth

As of 2025-06, FushionAuth does not natively support organization.
If you google, you can see there is an official documentation telling you to use Entity to model organization yourselves. See https://fusionauth.io/docs/extend/examples/modeling-organizations

In my opinion, doing this is a lot of hard work. It is like implementing organization in your own way.
