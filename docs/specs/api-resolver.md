# Session resolver API

Popular reverse proxy server supports delegating request authentication by initiating sub-request.

In nginx, it is the `auth_request` directive while in Traefik, it is `ForwardAuth`.

The resolve endpoint `/resolve` looks at `Cookie:` and `Authentication:` to authenticate the request. `Cookie:` has higher precedence.

The resolve endpoint does not write body. Instead, it adds the following headers in the response.

  * [x-authgear-session-valid](#x-authgear-session-valid)
  * [x-authgear-user-id](#x-authgear-user-id)
  * [x-authgear-user-anonymous](#x-authgear-user-anonymous)
  * [x-authgear-user-verified](#x-authgear-user-verified)
  * [x-authgear-user-claims](#x-authgear-user-claims)
  * [x-authgear-session-acr](#x-authgear-session-acr)
  * [x-authgear-session-amr](#x-authgear-session-amr)

## x-authgear-session-valid

Tell whether the session of the original request is valid.

If this header is absent, it means the original request is not associated with any session.

If the value is `true`, it indicates the original request has a valid session. More headers will be included.

If the value is `false`, it indicates the original request has invalid session.

## x-authgear-user-id

The user id.

## x-authgear-user-anonymous

The value `true` means the user is anonymous. Otherwise, it is a normal user.

## x-authgear-user-verified

The value `true` means the user is verified.

## x-authgear-user-claims

The [claims](./user-model.md#claims) encoded in URL Base64 encoding with padding.

## x-authgear-session-acr

See [the acr claim](./oidc.md#acr).

## x-authgear-session-amr

See [the amr claim](./oidc.md#amr). It is comma-separated.
