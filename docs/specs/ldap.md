# LDAP

This document describes the LDAP support in Authgear. Authgear acts as a LDAP client, and connects to one or more LDAP servers.

## Supported LDAP protocol

The supported LDAP protocol is LDAPv3, which is specified in [RFC4511](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4511).

Authgear MUST BE compatible with

1. A LDAP server without TLS (i.e. ldap://)
2. The non-standard ldaps://
3. The StartTLS operation, as defined in [Section 4.14 in RFC4511](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4511#section-4.14)

When the connection URL starts with `ldap://`, StartTLS will be tried.
If the LDAP server responds protocolError, as defined in [Section 4.14.1 in RFC4511](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4511#section-4.14.1),
then Authgear will treat it as no TLS is required.

When the connection URL starts with `ldaps://`, then Authgear will connect to the LDAP server with TLS directly, without using StartTLS.

## Authenticate Authgear as a LDAP client

It is very common that before a LDAP client can run any [Search Operation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4511#section-4.5),
the LDAP client must perform [Bind Operation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4511#section-4.2) first.

Authgear supports Simple Bind with username and password.

## Configuration of LDAP servers

The following example demonstrates how the developer should configure Authgear to connect to their LDAP servers.

In `authgear.yaml`

```yaml
identity:
  ldap:
    servers:
    - name: default
      url: "ldap://localhost:389"
      base_dn: "dc=localhost"
      search_filter_template: |
        {{- if (hasSuffix $.Username "@mycompany.com") }}
          (&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(memberof=dc=mycompany,dc=com)(sAMAccountName={{ $.Username }}))
        {{- else }}
          (&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(memberof=dc=anothercompany,dc=com)(sAMAccountName={{ $.Username }}))
        {{- end }}
      # According to https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4512#section-2.5
      # The unique way to identify an attribute in LDAP is oid.
      # For those who are curious, "0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1" is "uid", according to https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4519#section-2.39
      user_id_attribute_oid: "0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1"
```

- `identity.ldap.servers.name`: A unique name to identify this LDAP server. Once set, it cannot be changed. It is stored in the database as part of the unique key to identify a LDAP identity. See [The database schema of a LDAP identity](#the-database-schema-of-a-ldap-identity) for details.
- `identity.ldap.servers.url`: The connection URL to the LDAP server. The scheme MUST be `ldap:` or `ldaps:`. The URL MUST contain `host`, and optionally a port. If the port is omitted, the default port of the scheme is assumed. The default port of `ldap:` is `389`, while the default port of `ldaps:` is `636`. The URL MUST NOT contain other elements, such as path, nor query.
- `identity.ldap.servers.base_dn`: The base DN to construct a Search Request, as defined in [Section 4.5.1 in RFC4511](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4511#section-4.5.1).
- `identity.ldap.servers.search_filter_template`: A Go template that renders to a filter to be used in the Search Request. This template can use the variable `$.Username` to render the username entered by the end-user. `$.Username` is pre-processed so that it is an escaped LDAP string. The strings function from [https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) can be used in the template.
- `identity.ldap.servers.user_id_attribute_oid`: The attribute that is guaranteed to be unique and never change for a given user in the LDAP server. It is used to identify a user from the LDAP server. Warning: Changing this value will cause Authgear not able to look up any previous LDAP identities.

> Why does `identity.ldap.servers.url` allow scheme, host, and port?
> The LDAP URL, defined in [Section 2 in RFC 4516](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4516#section-2), is syntactically different from the URL defined in [RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986).
> In particular, a LDAP URL can contain multiple question mark characters.
> To ease implementation, we do not support the LDAP URL, and require a RFC3986 URL (which is implemented by the standard library net/url package).

> TODO: The current configuration is missing an important feature. The feature is allow the developer to specify what attributes they want to retrieve from the LDAP server, and
> what attributes map to which standard attributes.

In `authgear.secrets.yaml`

```yaml
secrets:
- data:
    items:
    - name: default
      username: authgear
      password: secret1
  key: ldap
```

- `items.name`: To associate a LDAP server in `authgear.yaml`.
- `items.username`: Optional. The username Authgear uses to authenticate itself to the LDAP server. If it is not provided, then Authgear does not authenticates itself, and assumes the LDAP server allows anonymous requests.
- `items.password`: Optional. The password Authgear uses to authenticate itself to the LDAP server. If `username` is provided, then `password` is required.

## Validation on the configuration

Here is the JSON schema for the LDAP server configuration.

```
{
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": ["name", "url", "base_dn", "search_filter_template", "user_id_attribute_oid"],
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 1
    },
    "url": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "ldap_url"
    },
    "base_dn": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "ldap_dn"
    },
    "search_filter_template": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "ldap_search_filter_template"
    },
    "user_id_attribute_oid": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "ldap_oid"
    }
  }
}
```

- `format: ldap_url`: It is a JSON schema format that implements the rules of `identity.ldap.servers.url`.
- `format: ldap_dn`: It is a JSON schema format that validates the value to be a valid DN.
- `format: ldap_search_filter_template`: It is a JSON schema format that validates the rendered string to be a valid Search Filter. It does the validation by running the template with `Username=user`, `Username=user@example.com`, and `Username=+85298765432`, and then parse the resulting Search Filter as a Search Filter.
- `format: ldap_oid`: It is a JSON schema format that validates the value to be a valid LDAP oid.

## Testing on the configuration

> TODO: Add a mutation in the Admin API to test LDAP connection.
> It should take the whole server configuration, and optionally a end-user username.
> It connects the LDAP server with the URL and the credentials.
> If the optional end-user username is given, it performs a Search request, and validates the user exists and has user_id_attribute_oid.
> It returns detailed API errors so that the portal can display relevant information for the developer to debug the configuration.
> Such detailed API errors ARE NOT returned in actual use. They are reported as internal errors.

## The database schema of a LDAP identity

```sql
CREATE TABLE _auth_identity_ldap
(
    id                      text  PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES _auth_identity (id),
    app_id                  text  NOT NULL,
    server_name             text  NOT NULL,
    user_id_attribute_oid   text  NOT NULL,
    user_id_attribute_value text  NOT NULL,
    claims                  jsonb NOT NULL,
    raw_entry_json          jsonb NOT NULL
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX _auth_identity_ldap_unique ON _auth_identity_ldap (app_id, server_name, user_id_attribute_oid, user_id_attribute_value);
```

- `id`: The primary key of this table. This is the same as other `_auth_identity_*` tables.
- `app_id`: The app ID of this table for multi-tenant. This is the same as other `_auth_identity_*` tables.
- `server_name`: The `name` of the LDAP server.
- `user_id_attribute_oid`: The `user_id_attribute_oid` of the LDAP server when this identity is created.
- `user_id_attribute_value`: The value of the `user_id_attribute_oid` of the user.
- `claims`: The standard claims extracted from this LDAP entry.
- `raw_entry_json`: The raw LDAP entry encoded in JSON. It looks like `{ "dn": "uid=johndoe,dc=example,dc=com", "attr1": ["value1"] }`.

## Handling of a LDAP identity

- To look up a LDAP identity in Authgear, we use the tuple `(app_id, server_name, user_id_attribute_oid, user_id_attribute_value)`.
- Similar to OAuth identity, we update an LDAP identity when it is used in login.

## The UX of LDAP in Auth UI

In the MVP phase (that is, now), sign in with LDAP is like sign in with an OAuth provider.
Except that the enter-username-and-password page is hosted by Authgear as a integral part of Auth UI.

In the future, we may consider an option to make LDAP "replaces" Login ID in the UX.

## Errors

This section documents the expected errors.

|Description|Name|Reason|Info|
|---|---|---|---|
|When the LDAP server is service unavailable, `user_id_attribute_oid` not found in a user, search filter turns out to be invalid, etc|InternalError|UnexpectedError||
|When the end-user cannot authenticate to the LDAP server|Unauthorized|InvalidCredentials||
