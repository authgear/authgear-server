# Event

## Event Definition

Events are triggered when an operation is performed.

Events have two kinds, namely Blocking and Non-blocking.

Blocking event is triggered before the operation is performed. The operation can be aborted by Hooks.

Non-blocking event is triggered after the operation is performed.

## Event Shape

All events have the following shape:

```json5
{
  "id": "0E1E9537-DF4F-4AF6-8B48-3DB4574D4F24",
  "seq": 435,
  "type": "user.created",
  "payload": { /* ... */ },
  "context": { /* ... */ }
}
```

- `id`: The ID of the event.
- `seq`: A monotonically increasing signed 64-bit integer.
- `type`: The type of the event.
- `payload`: The payload of the event, varies with type.
- `context`: The context of the event.

### Event Shape Versioning

All fields are guaranteed that only backward-compatible changes would be made.

- Existing fields would not be removed or changed in meaning.
- New fields may be added.

### Event Context

- `app_id`: The app ID.
- `client_id`: The client id, if present.
- `timestamp`: signed 64-bit UNIX timestamp of when this event is generated. Retried deliveries do not affect this field.
- `user_id`: The ID of the user associated with the event. It may be absent. For example, the user has not authenticated yet.
- `ip_address`: The IP address of the HTTP request, if present.
- `user_agent`: The User-Agent HTTP request header, if present.
- `triggered_by`: The origin of the event.
  - `user`: The event originates from a end-user facing UI.
  - `admin_api`: The event originates from the Admin API.
  - `system`: The event originates from a background job.
  - `portal`: The event originates from the management portal.
- `preferred_languages`: User preferred languages which are inferred from the request. It is the value of `ui_locales` query parameter if it is provided, or the value of the `Accept-Language` header. It is an empty array when the event is not generated by the end user.
- `language`: The locale which is derived based on user's preferred languages and app's languages config. The fallback value is the fallback language of the app.

## Event List

### Blocking Events

- [user.pre_create](#userpre_create)
- [user.profile.pre_update](#userprofilepre_update)

Blocking event Hooks can perform mutations. See [Blocking Event Mutations](./hook.md#blocking-event-mutations).

#### user.pre_create

Occurs right before the user creation. User can be created by user signup, user signup as anonymous user, admin api or admin portal create an user.

```json5
{
  "context": {
    ....
    "oauth": {
      "state": "the-value-of-state-if-provided"
    }
  },
  "payload": {
    "user": { /* ... */ },
    "identities": [ { /* ... */ } ]
  }
}
```

- `oauth.state`: OAuth state if the signup is triggered through authorize endpoint with state parameter.

#### user.profile.pre_update

Occurs right before the update of user profile.

```json5
{
  "payload": {
    "user": { /* ... */ }
  }
}
```

#### user.pre_schedule_deletion

Occurs right before the account deletion is scheduled.

```json5
{
  "payload": {
    "user": { /* ... */ }
  }
}
```

#### user.pre_schedule_anonymization

Occurs right before the account anonymization is scheduled.

```json5
{
  "payload": {
    "user": { /* ... */ }
  }
}
```

#### oidc.jwt.pre_create

Occurs right before the access token is issued.
Use this event to add custom fields to the JWT access token.

```json5
{
  "payload": {
    "user": { /* ... */ },
    "identities": [ ],
    "jwt": {
      "payload": {
        "iss": "issuer",
        "aud": ["audience"]
        "sub": "user_id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `identities`: This contain all Login ID identities, OAuth identities, or LDAP identities that the user has.
